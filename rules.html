      <h2>Instructions to have a "verified" speedrun:</h2>
      <div class="block">
1. Enable the speedrun timer before you jump into the map you will speedrun. This can be done by navigating to the homepage of the Ball Guys app ---> Settings (Gear Icon in top right) ---> Click "Speedrun clock"
1a. When you start the map, there should show a red timer that starts running immediately. If you don't see it, try restarting your app
2. Important: Please start screen recording from before you fire your first shot!
<u>Clarification notes:</u> It is generally best practice to respawn after setting up the screen recorder, because our leaderboard will use the official clock time no matter what- NOT from when you start shooting. if you fall in lava and auto respawn after this, theres no need to begin the hassle of a whole new screen recording, just keep attempting and crop the video afterwards from before the clock was at 00:00 :)
**3. IMPORTANT: Once you have completed a run, DO NOT respawn, and DO NOT end the recording yet- go to the menu, and press "spectate". This will allow the moderators to see the green timer with your precise and official time :)
<u>Note:</u> Runs that neglect to do this final step can still be verified as we will estimate the time- but bare in mind we round up to the nearest second in such cases which may cause your run to be less competitive- so please don't forget this final step :)

      <h2>Rules to have a "verified" glitchless run:</h2>
      <div class="block">
- Runs must be fully recorded, uncut, unedited, and run from before the start until after the finish
- Runs must not use any mods or glitches, yes, even the flying glitch (Sorry guys XD)
- Pauses of any kind, anything that freezes the clock, or your ball, such as using the control center etc. are not allowed and will cause a run to be rejected.
- Recorded runs must contain the apps in-built speedrun clock
        
Verified recordings will be kept in an archive by myself and linked publicly on the <a href="/home">leaderboard</a> for future inspection and transparency. The videos are mainly linked for education and entertainment, but anyone browsing the leaderboard will be able to replay your recording and report foul play/editting should they suspect it, which will cause us to re-review them.

If anyone would like to be part of that moderation team to help verify runs, let me (Abe) know through discord! Here is a <a href="https://discord.gg/ballguys" target="_blank" rel="noopener">link</a> to the Ball Guys Discord Server. Once there, Search "Abe" or "icarus1892" in the member search (Additionally, a direct link to the discord can be found at the top right corner of the main menu in ball guys under the gear icon.)

      <h2>Rules to submit:</h2>
      <div class="block">
- Use this <a href="/home/submissions">form</a>
or
- Contact me on <a href="https://discord.gg/ballguys" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discord</a> (contact info is right above this)

I will need:
- In Game Display name
- Map name
- Link to your video or screenshot: If you're submitting through the form, you may upload files directly through the form or link to any image or video hosting sites of your choosing (Youtube, Google Drive, imgur, dropbox, etc.)
(<u>Note:</u> If submitting through discord, you can simply send the media to me through discord as well)

One caveat- Screenshots will be considered "unverified" by default. not because I don't trust anybody in specific, just because I want standard to be applied to consistently to all runs :)

For the time being, submissions will be filed into 3 categories:
1- Unverified: Simple screenshots with no recording, or rejected videos that didn't follow the rules and instructions above
2- Pending Verification: Recordings that were submitted but not yet reviewed in detail by moderation team
3- Verified: Recording has been reviewed and approved by the moderation team

To be clear, ALL submitted runs (at least a screenshot of your time) will be tracked on the leaderboard, just marked with their corresponding categorization! :)
