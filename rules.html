      <h2>Instructions to have a “verified” speedrun:</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Enable the speedrun timer before you jump into the map you will speedrun.
          This can be done by navigating to the homepage of the Ball Guys app
          —&gt; Settings (Gear Icon in top right) —&gt; Click “Speedrun clock”.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1a.</strong> When you start the map, there should show a red timer that starts running immediately. If you don't see it, try restarting your app.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>2.</strong> <strong>Important:</strong> Please start screen recording from before you fire your first shot!<br>
          <span class="underline"><u>Clarification notes:</u></span>
          It is generally best practice to respawn after setting up the screen recorder,
          because our leaderboard will use the official clock time no matter what — NOT from when you start shooting.
          If you fall in lava and auto respawn after this, there’s no need to begin the hassle of a whole new screen recording,
          just keep attempting and crop the video afterwards from before the clock was at 00:00 :)
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>3. IMPORTANT:</strong> Once you have completed a run, DO NOT respawn, and DO NOT end the recording yet — go to the menu, and press “spectate”.
          This will allow the moderators to see the green timer with your precise and official time :)<br>
          <span class="underline"><u>Note:</u></span>
          Runs that neglect to do this final step can still be verified as we will estimate the time — but bare in mind we round up to the nearest second in such cases
          which may cause your run to be less competitive — so please don't forget this final step :)
        </li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="panel">
      <h2>Rules to have a “verified” glitchless run:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Runs must be fully recorded, uncut, unedited, and run from before the start until after the finish.</li>
        <li>Runs must not use any mods or glitches, yes, even the flying glitch (Sorry guys XD).</li>
        <li>Pauses of any kind, anything that freezes the clock, or your ball, such as using the control center etc. are not allowed and will cause a run to be rejected.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Verified recordings will be kept in an archive by myself and linked publicly on the
        <a href="/home">leaderboard</a> for future inspection and transparency. The videos are mainly linked for education and entertainment, but anyone browsing the leaderboard will be able to replay your recording and report foul play/editting should they suspect it, which will cause us to re-review them.
      </p>
      <p>
        If anyone would like to be part of that moderation team to help verify runs, let me (Abe) know through discord!
        Here is a <a href="https://discord.gg/ballguys" target="_blank" rel="noopener">link</a> to the Ball Guys Discord Server. Once there, Search “Abe” or “icarus1892” in the member search
        (Additionally, a direct link to the discord can be found at the top right corner of the main menu in ball guys under the gear icon.)
      </p>

    <div class="panel">
      <h2>Rules to submit:</h2>
      <p>
        — Use this <a href="/home/submissions">form</a><br>
        — or —<br>
        — Contact me on <a href="https://discord.gg/ballguys" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discord</a> (contact info is right above this)
      </p>

      <h3>I will need:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>User ID: (Ball Guys Home screen &gt; settings &gt; Copy User ID)</li>
        <li>In Game Display name</li>
        <li>Map name</li>
        <li>
          Link to your video or screenshot: If you're submitting through the form, you may use any image or video hosting sites of your choosing (Youtube, Google Drive, imgur, dropbox, etc.)
          <br><span class="underline"><u>Note:</u></span> If submitting through discord, you can simply send the media to me through discord.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        One caveat — Screenshots will be considered “unverified” by default. Not because I don't trust anybody in specific, just because I want standard to be applied consistently to all runs :)
      </p>

      <h3>For the time being, submissions will be filed into 3 categories:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Unverified:</strong> Simple screenshots with no recording, or rejected videos that didn't follow the rules and instructions above</li>
        <li><strong>Pending Verification:</strong> Recordings that were submitted but not yet reviewed in detail by moderation team</li>
        <li><strong>Verified:</strong> Recording has been reviewed and approved by the moderation team</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        To be clear, ALL submitted runs (at least a screenshot of your time) will be tracked on the leaderboard, just marked with their corresponding categorization! :)
